# Class Notes

This widget provides users an access to all the class notes and exam papers and other related information for the courses selected by them. The user can select the courses from the list of courses available on the dashboard. In addition to this , an upload button is available to the user for uploading any course related material, for example, class notes, exam papers, answer key to the reference book and many more. This will help class notes made by any student to be available to other students too, thereby reducing student's pain of asking every student and wandering here and there for notes.
