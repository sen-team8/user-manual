The only platform vaailable to Da-iict students for sending message to whole batch or to whole college is through Zimbra's webmail. But with the help of this widget, a student can broadcast messages to his/her whole batch or to whole college. It is very helpful in cases where there is a need of informal discussions among batchmates, or any kind of announcement or discussion which requires involvement of whole college.<br/>
