# Choose Widgets

The application is designed in a manner to provide user with a variety of widgets. As different users have different user requirements, DA-Dash provides its users with a widget catalog. This will help users to choose widgets of their choice without clustering a lot on personalized dashboard. Also, as user demands keep on changing from time-to-time, a new list of widgets could be added to the widget catalog at some later point of time.<br/>
In this page , user can mark required widgets and DA-Dash will provide the user with those widgets on their dashboard.<br/><br/>
This page provides user with two functionalities.
